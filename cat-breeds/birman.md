**Description:** The CFA describes the Birman as “the best friend you ever had.” This fluffy kitty is a gentle and quiet creature, often happy to socialize with both humans and other animals. Legend has it that Birman cats come from Buddhist temple cats in Burma (present-day Myanmar), where they were worshipped as the wise carriers of departed souls. In reality, most modern-day Birmans can trace their ancestors to France, England, and Germany.
