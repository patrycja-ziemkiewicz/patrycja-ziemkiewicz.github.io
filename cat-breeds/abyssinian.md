**Description:** Thanks to its lithe body, elegantly arched neck, short hair, and broad ears, the Abyssinian is believed to be one of the oldest cat breeds and related to the favored companions of Ancient Egyptians. While the exact origins of the Abyssinian are unknown, theCat Fanciersâ€™ Association(CFA) reports that the name is a result of the breed first being imported to England in the mid-1800s from Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia). Abyssinians make for fun pets today because of their playful, curious natures and openness to new people and situations. Many of these cats enjoy a nice game of fetch.
